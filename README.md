# ATmega32 Drivers

This repository contains a collection of drivers for the ATmega32 microcontroller, facilitating the use of various peripherals and features including GPIO, ADC, SPI, UART, Timer, Keyboard, 7-Segment Display, and EEPROM. These drivers simplify the development process for projects based on the ATmega32 MCU.



## Features

- GPIO Driver: Simplifies GPIO pin configuration and manipulation
- ADC Driver: Enables analog-to-digital conversion with ease.
- SPI Driver: Provides SPI communication capabilities.
- UART Driver: Facilitates UART communication.
- Timer Driver: Makes delays and used to call functions after some delay(callback function).
- Keyboard Driver: Supports interfacing with a keypad or keyboard matrix.
- 7-Segment Display Driver: Simplifies controlling 7-segment displays.
- EEPROM Driver: Provides easy access to EEPROM memory.
